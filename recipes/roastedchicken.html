    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
        <li><strong>Callery:</strong> Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
        <li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
        <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
    </ol>
